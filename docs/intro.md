# Welcome to Apiary

Apiary is a distributed data processing framework inspired by bee colony intelligence. It is designed to run on inexpensive hardware -- Raspberry Pis, NUCs, old laptops -- while scaling seamlessly to cloud compute. Users write data via Python, query via SQL, and the swarm distributes work across available nodes with no central controller.

## How these docs are organized

This documentation follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which separates content by its purpose:

### Tutorials

**Learning-oriented.** Step-by-step guided lessons that take you from zero to a working Apiary deployment. Start here if you are new.

- [Your First Apiary](/docs/tutorials/your-first-apiary) -- Install, create data, query it
- [Sensor Data Pipeline](/docs/tutorials/sensor-data-pipeline) -- Build a realistic data pipeline with partitioning and aggregations
- [Multi-Node Swarm](/docs/tutorials/multi-node-swarm) -- Set up a distributed cluster with Docker Compose

### How-to Guides

**Task-oriented.** Practical steps for accomplishing specific goals. You know what you want to do; these show you how.
